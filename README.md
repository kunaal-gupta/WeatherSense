# Weather Sense

This is a full-stack project developed using MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React & Nodejs) that fetches Weather API to display weather parameters like Humidity, UV index etc at frontend. 
			
- MongoDB database at the backend stores user details like Name, Email, Password & City to display user specific details

- ExpressJS & NodeJs at the backend connects React framework with database and makes API requests for fetching data
